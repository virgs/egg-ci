# Engineering Guidelines for AI Agent

## 1. Think Before Coding

* Always reason step by step before writing code.
* Understand the problem, constraints, edge cases, and future impact.
* Design with long-term maintainability in mind.
* Plan how the feature integrates with the existing architecture.
* Prefer extensible patterns to quick fixes.

---

## 2. Code Quality Standards

All code must be:

* Clean and readable
* Modular and reusable
* Well-documented (clear naming over excessive comments)
* Secure and defensive (handle edge cases)
* Efficient and performant
* Easy to debug and test
* Following TypeScript and React best practices

Prefer:

* Strong typing (avoid `any`)
* Explicit return types always
* Clear naming conventions
* Predictable data flow

---

## 3. Architecture & Size Constraints

Keep everything small and focused.

### Size Limits (Soft Constraints)

* Functions: ≤ 30 lines, ≤ 4 parameters
* Components: ≤ 150 lines
* Classes: ≤ 150 lines
* Files: ≤ 200 lines

If something grows too large:

* Extract smaller components
* Extract custom hooks
* Extract utility modules
* Apply Single Responsibility Principle

Each unit should have one clear responsibility.

---

## 4. Incremental Development

* Avoid large refactors.
* Make small, testable changes.
* Ensure each step can be validated and rolled back.
* Preserve system stability while adding features.

---

## 5. User Experience First

* Consider how users interact with the feature.
* Optimize clarity, feedback, and usability.
* Avoid unnecessary complexity in UI.
* Keep state management predictable.

---

## 6. Styling Rules

* Each component must have a matching SCSS file.

    * `ComponentName.tsx`
    * `ComponentName.scss`
* Keep styles scoped and organized.
* Maintain naming consistency.
* Update SCSS files when renaming components.

---

## 7. Async & Function Conventions

* Use `async/await` instead of `.then()`
* Prefer arrow functions over regular functions
* Handle errors explicitly with try/catch
* Avoid nested async logic

---

## 8. Testing Requirements

* Keep tests updated with every change.
* Cover:

    * New features
    * Edge cases
    * Critical flows
* Maintain strong coverage.
* Tests must reflect real usage scenarios.

---

## 9. Documentation & Project Memory

Maintain these files:

### `memento.md`

Store:

* Architectural decisions
* Important design choices
* Context and constraints
* Trade-offs made
* Key references or links

### `README.md`

Update when:

* Adding features
* Changing behavior
* Modifying setup or usage

---

## 10. After Completing Any Task

Always:

1. Create/Update `memento.md` with decisions/context
2. Update `README.md` if behavior changed
3. Update/add tests once any code is written
4. Review code quality
5. Refactor if needed
6. Ensure size constraints are respected

---

## 11. Long-Term Vision

* Ensure new features align with overall architecture.
* Avoid shortcuts that create technical debt.
* Think about scalability and future extensibility.
* Prefer composability over monolithic solutions.

---

# Summary Philosophy

Think long-term.
Keep everything small and the tests in sync.
Write predictable, testable, modular code.
Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
Update documentation continuously.
Build incrementally and safely.


# TODO list

1. [x] I want to add another view to the workflows page. Currently, there are list/grid. I want to add a compact one to the same button group. This view mode will hide the card body and footer, showing only the header. It will also allow more cards per row, so you can see more jobs at a glance. This will be especially useful for users with many jobs or those who prefer a more minimalist dashboard. Keep the card width the same. If the screen is wide enough, show 2 workflows per row and make the main container as wide as the screen. This way, users can see more workflows without scrolling, while still having a clear view of each job's status. If the screen is narrower, keep the current behavior of showing 1 workflow per row. This will ensure that the dashboard remains usable and visually appealing on smaller screens, while maximizing the amount of information displayed on larger screens. Ask questions if you need clarification on the design or implementation details.
2. [ ] Microsoft teams integration.
