# Engineering Guidelines for AI Agent

## 1. Think Before Coding

* Always reason step by step before writing code.
* Understand the problem, constraints, edge cases, and future impact.
* Design with long-term maintainability in mind.
* Plan how the feature integrates with the existing architecture.
* Prefer extensible patterns to quick fixes.

---

## 2. Code Quality Standards

All code must be:

* Clean and readable
* Modular and reusable
* Well-documented (clear naming over excessive comments)
* Secure and defensive (handle edge cases)
* Efficient and performant
* Easy to debug and test
* Following TypeScript and React best practices

Prefer:

* Strong typing (avoid `any`)
* Explicit return types always
* Clear naming conventions
* Predictable data flow

---

## 3. Architecture & Size Constraints

Keep everything small and focused.

### Size Limits (Soft Constraints)

* Functions: ≤ 30 lines, ≤ 4 parameters
* Components: ≤ 150 lines
* Classes: ≤ 150 lines
* Files: ≤ 200 lines

If something grows too large:

* Extract smaller components
* Extract custom hooks
* Extract utility modules
* Apply Single Responsibility Principle

Each unit should have one clear responsibility.

---

## 4. Incremental Development

* Avoid large refactors.
* Make small, testable changes.
* Ensure each step can be validated and rolled back.
* Preserve system stability while adding features.

---

## 5. User Experience First

* Consider how users interact with the feature.
* Optimize clarity, feedback, and usability.
* Avoid unnecessary complexity in UI.
* Keep state management predictable.

---

## 6. Styling Rules

* Each component must have a matching SCSS file.

    * `ComponentName.tsx`
    * `ComponentName.scss`
* Keep styles scoped and organized.
* Maintain naming consistency.
* Update SCSS files when renaming components.

---

## 7. Async & Function Conventions

* Use `async/await` instead of `.then()`
* Prefer arrow functions over regular functions
* Handle errors explicitly with try/catch
* Avoid nested async logic

---

## 8. Testing Requirements

* Keep tests updated with every change.
* Cover:

    * New features
    * Edge cases
    * Critical flows
* Maintain strong coverage.
* Tests must reflect real usage scenarios.

---

## 9. Documentation & Project Memory

Maintain these files:

### `memento.md`

Store:

* Architectural decisions
* Important design choices
* Context and constraints
* Trade-offs made
* Key references or links

### `README.md`

Update when:

* Adding features
* Changing behavior
* Modifying setup or usage

---

## 10. After Completing Any Task

Always:

1. Create/Update `memento.md` with decisions/context
2. Update `README.md` if behavior changed
3. Update/add tests once any code is written
4. Review code quality
5. Refactor if needed
6. Ensure size constraints are respected

---

## 11. Long-Term Vision

* Ensure new features align with overall architecture.
* Avoid shortcuts that create technical debt.
* Think about scalability and future extensibility.
* Prefer composability over monolithic solutions.

---

# Summary Philosophy

Think long-term.
Keep everything small and the tests in sync.
Write predictable, testable, modular code.
Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
Update documentation continuously.
Build incrementally and safely.


# TODO list

1. [x] The workflow page buttons on top (filter, list/grid view and expand/collapse) should have tooltips. Also, in the settings page, there should be a button to alternate the theme (light/dark) and it should have a tooltip as well. The light mode should be the default, and the dark mode should be optional for those who prefer it. The light theme should use (import 'bootswatch/dist/sandstone/bootstrap.min.css') and the dark should be (import 'bootswatch/dist/slate/bootstrap.min.css'). Make it easy for me to change them if I have to and tell me how to do it.
2. [ ] Ideas for screenshot explanations.
