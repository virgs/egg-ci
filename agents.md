# Engineering Guidelines for AI Agent

## 1. Think Before Coding

* Always reason step by step before writing code.
* Understand the problem, constraints, edge cases, and future impact.
* Design with long-term maintainability in mind.
* Plan how the feature integrates with the existing architecture.
* Prefer extensible patterns to quick fixes.

---

## 2. Code Quality Standards

All code must be:

* Clean and readable
* Modular and reusable
* Well-documented (clear naming over excessive comments)
* Secure and defensive (handle edge cases)
* Efficient and performant
* Easy to debug and test
* Following TypeScript and React best practices

Prefer:

* Strong typing (avoid `any`)
* Explicit return types always
* Clear naming conventions
* Predictable data flow

---

## 3. Architecture & Size Constraints

Keep everything small and focused.

### Size Limits (Soft Constraints)

* Functions: ≤ 30 lines, ≤ 4 parameters
* Components: ≤ 150 lines
* Classes: ≤ 150 lines
* Files: ≤ 200 lines

If something grows too large:

* Extract smaller components
* Extract custom hooks
* Extract utility modules
* Apply Single Responsibility Principle

Each unit should have one clear responsibility.

---

## 4. Incremental Development

* Avoid large refactors.
* Make small, testable changes.
* Ensure each step can be validated and rolled back.
* Preserve system stability while adding features.

---

## 5. User Experience First

* Consider how users interact with the feature.
* Optimize clarity, feedback, and usability.
* Avoid unnecessary complexity in UI.
* Keep state management predictable.

---

## 6. Styling Rules

* Each component must have a matching SCSS file.

    * `ComponentName.tsx`
    * `ComponentName.scss`
* Keep styles scoped and organized.
* Maintain naming consistency.
* Update SCSS files when renaming components.

---

## 7. Async & Function Conventions

* Use `async/await` instead of `.then()`
* Prefer arrow functions over regular functions
* Handle errors explicitly with try/catch
* Avoid nested async logic

---

## 8. Testing Requirements

* Keep tests updated with every change.
* Cover:

    * New features
    * Edge cases
    * Critical flows
* Maintain strong coverage.
* Tests must reflect real usage scenarios.

---

## 9. Documentation & Project Memory

Maintain these files:

### `memento.md`

Store:

* Architectural decisions
* Important design choices
* Context and constraints
* Trade-offs made
* Key references or links

### `README.md`

Update when:

* Adding features
* Changing behavior
* Modifying setup or usage

---

## 10. After Completing Any Task

Always:

1. Create/Update `memento.md` with decisions/context
2. Update `README.md` if behavior changed
3. Update/add tests once any code is written
4. Review code quality
5. Refactor if needed
6. Ensure size constraints are respected

---

## 11. Long-Term Vision

* Ensure new features align with overall architecture.
* Avoid shortcuts that create technical debt.
* Think about scalability and future extensibility.
* Prefer composability over monolithic solutions.

---

# Summary Philosophy

Think long-term.
Keep everything small and the tests in sync.
Write predictable, testable, modular code.
Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
Update documentation continuously.
Build incrementally and safely.


# TODO list

1. [ ] Split the workflowPage component into smaller components. The current file is too large and hard to maintain. Consider creating separate components for the workflow list, workflow details, and workflow history.
2. [ ] Replace everything possible from bootstrap with its equivalent in react-bootstrap. You may have to add 'import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
   ' in the index.tsx file to make sure the styles are applied.'' because I didn't do anything yet.
3. [ ] In the workflows page, when the workflow view is in list mode, the history bars should be smaller. Half of it's current width so it can fit all 10 of them without the need of two lines.
